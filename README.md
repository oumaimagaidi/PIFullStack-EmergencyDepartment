## Key Features ‚ú®

### Accessibility Features ‚ôø
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS) on Interaction:** Provides vocal feedback by reading out the text content or accessible labels of interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) and important content on hover and focus events.
*   **Configurable TTS Language:** Users can select their preferred language for vocal output from a list of available voices detected in their browser/system.
    *   **User Story:** As a visually impaired user, I want the website to read out the text of interactive elements when I hover over or focus them, so that I can easily understand and navigate the content without relying solely on sight.

### Electronic Medical Records (EMR) & Documents üìÑ

*   Doctors can easily consult **all medical records of their assigned patients**.

### Emergency Patient Management üö®
*   Intuitive patient **registration portal** for emergency cases.
*   **Real-time status tracking** interface allowing patients/guardians to monitor their request progress (e.g., Registered, Under Review, Doctor Assigned, En Route, Treated).
*   **Estimated Wait Time (ETA) Calculation:** Provides patients with a dynamically estimated waiting time based on current department load and staffing.
*   **Automated Doctor Assignment:** System logic to automatically assign available doctors to new or waiting emergency cases.
*   Medical dossier **access codes** providing a secure method for patients/guardians to access limited information about their medical record status or documents.
*   **SMS Notifications:** Patients can receive key status updates via SMS if a phone number is provided during registration.
*   **AI Symptom Analysis:** Basic AI integration during registration to analyze the patient's description of symptoms, providing suggested keywords and clarifying questions to improve information quality.

### Ambulance Coordination & Tracking üöë
*   Live **ambulance location tracking** displayed on an interactive map interface for both staff and patients.
*   Patient-initiated **ambulance requests** via the application.
*   Staff interface for **ambulance dispatch and management**, including status updates (Available, On Mission, Maintenance) and team assignment.
*   Real-time **ETA calculations** and route visualization from the ambulance's current location to the patient's pickup location.
*   Staff dashboards provide a clear overview of **ambulance availability** and ongoing missions.

### Staff & Administration Management üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
*   Comprehensive **Staff Directory** listing all medical and administrative personnel with key contact information and roles.
*   **User Statistics and Analytics:** Dashboard views providing insights into user distribution by role, total patients, emergency case trends, etc.
*   **Resource Inventory Management:** System for tracking and managing hospital resources (beds, equipment), including location and status (available, in maintenance).
*   Ability for authorized staff (Admins, Nurses) to **allocate resources to specific patients**.
*   Real-time **Notifications System** for staff alerts regarding patient status changes, doctor assignments, new emergency cases, ambulance alerts, etc.
*   Staff **AI Chat Assistant:** An integrated chatbot allowing medical staff to query patient data, resource availability, etc., using natural language, providing quick, contextual information retrieval.
*   Internal Medical **Forum** for staff to discuss cases, protocols, and share information securely.
*   Staff account **validation and role management** (primarily for Administrators).

## Getting Started üö¶
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/oumaimagaidi/PIFullStack-EmergencyDepartment.git
    cd PIFullStack-EmergencyDepartment
    ```
2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
    *   Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
    *   **Crucial:** Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on the example (if any) and configure your **MongoDB URI**, **JWT Secret**, and **API keys** for **Twilio**, **OpenAI**, and **Hugging Face** (HF_ACCESS_TOKEN, potentially HF_QA_MODEL). Ensure `PORT` is set to `8089`.
    *   Start the backend server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
    *   **Check Backend Logs:** Verify that MongoDB connects successfully and the server starts listening on port 8089.
3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    *   Navigate back to the root directory, then to the frontend directory: `cd ../frontend`
    *   Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
    *   **Crucial:** Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory based on the example (if any) and configure your backend API URL (`VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8089`) and any other necessary keys (e.g., VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY if used).
    *   Start the frontend development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
4.  **Access the Application:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your frontend Vite config).
5.  **Ensure MongoDB is running:** Make sure your MongoDB server is running and accessible at the URI specified in the backend's `.env`.
6.  **Check Browser Console:** Look for any `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or other errors indicating the frontend cannot reach the backend.
